            replicates the core functionalities and user interface of the Myntra
            e-commerce platform. The project utilizes web development
            technologies such as React, Redux, React Router, Node.js, Bootstrap,

            includes navigation features, and changes made, such as adding
            products to the bag, are dynamically reflected.
